Project Repository Setup Instructions for Collaborators

To ensure a smooth setup process for all collaborators, follow these steps to clone, configure, and sync your local repository with the remote GitHub repository.

1. Clone the Repository

Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project, then run:

cd /path/to/your/directory  # Change to your desired location
git clone https://github.com/workoholyguy/DSCI4780_SPRIN-2025_THE-TECH-TITANS.git

2. Navigate to the Project Folder

cd DSCI4780_SPRIN-2025_THE-TECH-TITANS

3. Configure Git (If Not Set Up)

Check if your Git user information is correctly configured:

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

If necessary, update your global configuration by running:

git config --global --edit

4. Set the Main Branch (If Needed)

Ensure your branch is set to main:

git branch -M main

5. Pull Latest Changes from Remote

Since the remote repository may already have changes, fetch and merge them:

git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

This prevents errors when merging different Git histories.

6. Add Your Changes

Once you've made modifications, stage your changes:

git add .

7. Commit Your Changes

Commit with a meaningful message:

git commit -m "Describe your changes"

8. Push Changes to the Remote Repository

Upload your commits to the shared GitHub repository:

git push origin main

9. Regularly Sync with the Remote Repository

Before making any new changes, always pull the latest updates to avoid merge conflicts:

git pull origin main

By following these steps, all collaborators can maintain a consistent workflow while working on the project.
